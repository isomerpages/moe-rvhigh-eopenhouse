We are happy that our efforts in promoting mental well-being are recognised. <br> <img src="/images/Mental Health Award.jpg" style="width:85%">  |

| <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>**Excellence in Mathematics Teaching Award 2021**  | <img src="/images/Pearl Lam.jpeg" style="width:60%"><br>The Excellence in Mathematics Teaching Award (EMTA) affirms Singapore teachers who are passionate in mathematics teaching, have displayed exemplary efforts in the teaching of mathematics, and are role models to their colleagues and the mathematics teaching fraternity in Singapore.  Ms Pearl Lam, our teacher for JC Mathematics, is one of the four recipients of the EMTA this year. Her subject mastery is evident in her purposefully designed lessons which engage and empower her students to develop greater confidence, interest and understanding in this discipline. She measures her success through her students’ enjoyment in their learning and ability to solve problems independently. She is also inspired to empower students with analytical and reasoning skills imparted by mathematics so that they are better equipped for future challenges. With Ms Lam’s commitment and passion in the teaching of mathematics, this award is indeed a validation of her excellent work in River Valley High School.  |
| <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>**Outstanding Youth in Education**<br>**Award (OYEA)**  | <img src="/images/OYEA.jpg" style="width:85%"> <br>The OYEA is a national award that recognises and honours the achievements of young educators who have a passion and commitment to teaching, inspiring and nurturing their students. HOD / History Mr Shane Koh was one of the six recipients of the OYEA in 2020. As a teacher, he adopts innovative pedagogies such as role-play and historical simulations to create engaging and memorable learning experiences for his students. Heading the school’s History and Current Affairs Society (HACAS), Mr Koh expanded the club’s programmes over the years to include weekly academic discussions, film screenings, a guest speaker series, a student publication - ‘The Historian’, and an array of competitions that enhance students’ interest in this field. For HACAS’ flagship programme, the RV Model United Nations (RVMUN), Mr Koh empowers his students to plan and organise it for close to 400 students from different schools across Singapore, and RVMUN is a highly anticipated event for youths in junior colleges across Singapore every year. Given Mr Koh’s enthusiasm, passion and active involvement in the shaping and development of students’ interest in History, this award is an affirmation of his excellent work.
