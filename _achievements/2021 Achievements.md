Her subject mastery is evident in her purposefully designed lessons which engage and empower her students to develop greater confidence, interest and understanding in this discipline. She measures her success through her students’ enjoyment in their learning and ability to solve problems independently. She is also inspired to empower students with analytical and reasoning skills imparted by mathematics so that they are better equipped for future challenges. With Ms Lam’s commitment and passion in the teaching of mathematics, this award is indeed a validation of her excellent work in River Valley High School.  |
