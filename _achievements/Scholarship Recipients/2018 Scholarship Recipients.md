River Valley High School is proud to announce that Stefan Liew Jing Rui (Class of 2017) has been awarded the President’s Scholarship. The President’s Scholarship, awarded to the most deserving PSC (Public Service Commission) Scholarship recipients, is the most prestigious scholarship awarded in Singapore. Recipients are selected by the Commission for their character, leadership potential, as well as their outstanding academic and co-curricular achievements. Stefan truly exemplifies our school values as he continues to pursue excellence while remaining resilient, and proactively serves the community with empathy and kindness.

Throughout his time in RVHS, Stefan was heavily involved in the Student Council, the Science Leaders’ Academy, and various other activities. Stefan’s time as the President of the Student Council (2016-2017) saw him helm many school-wide events and initiatives. He was also an executive committee member of the Science Leaders’ Academy in 2016. His research project under the Science Mentorship Programme organised by the Ministry of Education was awarded the GlaxoSmithKline Sustainability Researcher Merit Award in 2016. His exceptional performance led to his representing Singapore for the MOE Overseas Student Attachment Programme in Gottingen, Germany.

Stefan also takes a keen interest in national affairs. He was a member of the National Education Council, where he actively engaged in meaningful exchanges on issues of national concern. Despite his busy schedule, Stefan still found time to contribute to society through volunteering regularly at the Buona Vista Community Club, where he tutored underprivileged Primary School students in Mathematics. He was keen to share his knowledge with the students, and always demonstrated patience in guiding them. These experiences developed him as a civic-minded citizen, with a strong understanding of the needs of our community. 

Stefan has remained humble in spite of all his achievements. As the valedictorian of the Class of 2017, Stefan reminds RVians that ‘education is a privilege that we frequently take for granted, a blessing that is denied to many, but the most important weapon to fight inequality and injustice’.  He is currently pursuing his liberal arts degree at Yale-NUS College in Singapore. 

We would like to congratulate Stefan and his family, as well as all teachers and friends who have been a part of his six-year journey in RVHS.
