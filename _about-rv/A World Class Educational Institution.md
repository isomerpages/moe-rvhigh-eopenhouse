## A World-Class Educational Institution

<img src="/images/World Class Institiution.jpg" style="width:85%">

Founded in 1956, River Valley High School (RVHS) is a forward-looking educational institution steeped in history and eastern culture. Since it was founded more than 55 years ago, RVHS has nurtured many generations of Singaporeans and has garnered many awards and accolades.

In 1979, owing to her strong Chinese roots, RVHS was designated as a Special Assistance Plan (SAP) School. In 1994, RVHS was selected to be in the pioneer batch of six schools to be granted the Autonomous Status (AS). In 2006, RVHS was again given the green light to run the Integrated Programme (IP) by the Ministry of Education. These give RVHS its present status as an S.I.A. school, where S stands for SAP, I stands for IP and A stands for AS.

The school is committed to providing our students with a holistic education and we develop each child to his fullest in the intellectual, social, moral, emotional, physical and aesthetic domains. This is done through our Balanced Education Curriculum (BEC), which comprises the [Cognitive-Interest Development Curriculum](https://rivervalleyhigh.moe.edu.sg/rvip/cognitive-interest-development-curriculum) (CIDC), the [Leadership-Character Development Curriculum](https://rivervalleyhigh.moe.edu.sg/rvip/leadership-character-development-curriculum) (LCDC) and the [Co-Curricular Activities Curriculum](https://rivervalleyhigh.moe.edu.sg/rvip/co-curricular-activities-curriculum) (CCAC). As a Special Assistance Plan (SAP), [Integrated Programme](https://rivervalleyhigh.moe.edu.sg/rvip/integrated-programme) (IP), and Autonomous school, we also seek to develop all students to be bicultural and effectively bilingual in English and Chinese.
