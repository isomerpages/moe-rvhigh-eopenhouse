## Education & Career Guidance

<img src="/images/ECG Learning Journey to National Parks Board.jpg" style="width:60%">

The Education & Career Guidance (ECG) department aims to inspire students to be proactive in the process of exploring different career options, to inculcate in them an appreciation for different occupations and the complex challenges different career paths will hold, as well as appreciate the need to be lifelong learners and add value to their future workplace. Over the years, students participate in career talks and learning journeys to different workplaces. They also conduct interviews with professionals and take part in a comprehensive personality type workshop designed to give them greater awareness of their learning styles and career preferences.
