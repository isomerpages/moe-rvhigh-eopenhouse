The Student Development Department focuses on the holistic development and welfare of the students. Our aim is to build a culture of care by building positive relationships amongst teachers, between teachers and student, and amongst students. The desired outcomes are that students enjoy coming to school, are engaged in learning and motivated to give of their best. To achieve these goals, Deans and Year Masters collaborate with the school and parents to promote student well-being. They work closely with Form Teachers to ensure students’ holistic development by monitoring students’ progress and identifying concerns related to the level. Through formal meetings and casual chats with students, Year Masters solicit feedback to better understand the needs of students. There is learning support and intervention for specific groups of students who require additional help.  Platforms for bonding activities and teacher-student interaction include the Cohesion Hike for the Senior High students and Sports Carnival for Junior High students.  
  
In addition, Year Masters design monthly professional sharing sessions for Form Teachers. These sessions serve to facilitate discussions on how to enhance Teacher-Student Relationships and promote student well-being by incorporating the principles of Positive Education. These Care and Share sessions equip teachers with competencies for their role in student development too. Year Masters also curate the school’s assembly programme and address students on issues pertaining to their level.  
  
The Student Development Department plays an important role in many of the events throughout the year. The team works closely with the Parent-Teacher Association to plan programmes that support the school’s efforts in developing their children holistically.  It has a voice in many of the school’s key programmes to ensure student-centricity in the decision-making process.
