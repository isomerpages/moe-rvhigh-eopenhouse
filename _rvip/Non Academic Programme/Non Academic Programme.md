## Non-Academic Programme

River Valley High Schoolâ€™s non-academic curriculum empowers students in leadership and character development, equipping them the tools and skills to work with their peers, manage teams and lead with integrity. Through age-appropriate lessons conducted within an authentic context, teachers serve as mentors and coaches for our youths to set their own personal and professional goals.
