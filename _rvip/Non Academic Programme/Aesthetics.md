The Aesthetics departmentâ€™s 3E Aesthetics model gives our students the opportunity to be engaged in the Arts by creating and responding to the Arts, to express by actively performing and to be empowered by the Arts, which eventually results in their lifelong involvement in the arts. This framework also works towards building a more vibrant arts culture in the school by creating more platforms for students to be involved in the Arts.
