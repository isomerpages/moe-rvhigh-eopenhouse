The Leadership and Character Development Department nurtures leaders of distinction who possess sterling character to serve the community and country. Through a curriculum that encompasses Character Education, Active Citizenry and Student Leadership, students learn experientially in authentic conditions to be ready for leadership in the community, nation and beyond.  
  
The Character Education programmes focus on holistic development at the personal leadership level. The programmes inculcate good values and develop social-emotional competencies alongside social, national, cultural and moral consciousness of the students.    
  
Active Citizenry give students opportunities through learning journeys, National Education commemorative events and other activities to cultivate in students a sense of pride and belonging to Singapore that will lead them to contribute towards the sustained development of Singapore. Active Citizenry also educates students on the significance of socio-cultural diversity in Singapore and the importance of social cohesion, racial and religious harmony. Students are also exposed to local and overseas platforms to interact with the community around them through service. It focuses on the application of core values, and also inculcates in students an appreciation of people, places and environment around them.    
  
For Student Leadership, students are grounded in values, equipped with leadership skills and competencies through experiential platforms. The Student Council is the apex of student leadership in the school, and it is supported by the various CCA councils in the school. As a whole, they provide a myriad of opportunities for students to lead and excel in different areas of interests through Personal Leadership, Team Leadership and Community Leadership.
