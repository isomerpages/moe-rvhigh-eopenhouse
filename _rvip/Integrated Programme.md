**6-Year Integrated Programme**<br>
As one of the few schools that offer a 6-year Integrated Programme, we customise and design our programme to provide a seamless development of RVians' talent and potential to the fullest.

**Interdisciplinary Applied Learning**<br>
Our Cognitive-Interest Development Curriculum is designed to deepen students’ 21st century competencies and prepare them to overcome challenges with confidence. Our programmes emphasise the application of critical thinking skills across subject disciplines and an acquisition of a broad and deep foundation through applied learning experiences in authentic settings. For instance, in our Construct, Integrate, Differentiate Programme, RVians employ their skills and knowledge across various disciplines to identify and solve real-world problems.

**All-Round Development**<br>
We place great emphasis on holistic education in RV. Our Integrated Programme focuses on producing leaders of sterling character, developing RVians to their fullest academic potential and nurturing their talent in co-curricular activities.

**Strong Partnerships**<br>
RVians have many invaluable opportunities to be mentored by top researchers and professors in leading institutions, as well as go on immersion programmes in top overseas schools and universities. This gives them an advantage and puts them in good stead to excel in our globalised world.
