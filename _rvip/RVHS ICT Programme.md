## RVHS ICT Programme

The objective of the progamme is to _**integrate technology into our 21st century learning environment to nurture thinkers, leaders and achievers with global perspectives.**_

The RVHS ICT experience aims to nurture future ready Singaporeans and equip students with MOE’s 21st Century Competencies. We hope that students will become self-directed and collaborative learners, critical thinkers and be designers of their own learning through new pedagogies presented by ICT.

The benefit of using ICT is that it allows for anytime, anywhere learning, ability to access information for Self-directed and Collaborative Learning whenever required. Through the use of different apps, students are able to choose the type of product they construct to demonstrate their understanding. This is the goal of RV Integrated Programme which is in line with 21st Century Competencies.

#### Cyberwellness @ RV

To emphasize the proper learning usage of computing devices in River Valley High School, iPads and other computing devices are referred to as Personal Learning Devices (PLDs). A series of measures are put in place to inculcate and to remind students of responsible usage.  

**PLD Usage Guidelines**<br>
The PLD usage guidelines builds upon MOE's R3ICH core values and details how PLD should be use in school.

<img src="/images/PLD Guidelines Posters.jpg" style="width:85%">

**Acceptable Usage Policy**<br>
The Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP) is an agreement made by the students to adhere to the guidelines for proper PLD usage. There are 2 parts to the AUP - the first part is between the student and the school; the second part is between the student and the parent. The parent-student AUP requires the parent and the student to work out a mutual agreement on what constitutes to acceptable usage of PLD at home. The parent-student AUP is a dynamic agreement and will need to be revised as the student grows. Often than not, the AUP serve as a 'conversation starter' between the student and the parent of PLD usage at home.

AUP is available for download [here](/files/AUP%20EL%20&%20CL.pdf).
