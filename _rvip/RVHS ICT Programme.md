## RVHS ICT Programme

The objective of the progamme is to _**integrate technology into our 21st century learning environment to nurture thinkers, leaders and achievers with global perspectives.**_

The RVHS ICT experience aims to nurture future ready Singaporeans and equip students with MOE’s 21st Century Competencies. We hope that students will become self-directed and collaborative learners, critical thinkers and be designers of their own learning through new pedagogies presented by ICT.

The benefit of using ICT is that it allows for anytime, anywhere learning, ability to access information for Self-directed and Collaborative Learning whenever required. Through the use of different apps, students are able to choose the type of product they construct to demonstrate their understanding. This is the goal of RV Integrated Programme which is in line with 21st Century Competencies.
