The Mathematics Department aims to nurture thinking students and to inculcate in them intellectual curiosity, passion and confidence in mathematical problem-solving through purposeful learning experiences.  
  
Students who exhibit high potential are channeled to the Mathematics Leaders Academy and/or the Infinity Programme where they undergo rigorous training in the Singapore Mathematical Olympiad. They also participate in learning journey, workshops and research mentored by academics from institutes of higher learning. Mathematics Leaders also have the opportunities to lead in major events organised for primary schools and RV.  
  
To extend mathematics learning, the department brings students overseas to better understand the function of numeracy and logical derivations in various sectors such as finance and high-tech industries. To create further opportunities for students who want to be challenged on a different platform, the department also runs a research-based modules for interested Year 4 students. After a few introductory lessons, these students embark on an independent research under the mentorship of their teachers.
