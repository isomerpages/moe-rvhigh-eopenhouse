The English Department is committed to nurturing students who are strong and confident communicators: individuals who are thinkers, leaders, and achievers with a global perspective. We want our students to achieve the competencies that will allow them to thrive in the 21stÂ century: critical and inventive thinking; communication, collaboration and information skills; civic literacy, global awareness, and cross-cultural skills.  

In this light, the English Department has implemented a range of programmes to support students in their learning. In Years 1 and 2, students are exposed to rich texts that build empathy and cross-cultural understanding; in Years 3 and 4, students are stretched through complex texts that demand intellectual rigour and close reading; in Years 5 and 6, students broaden their perspective of the world and take ownership of their learning. Students who choose to take Literature are given the opportunity to study texts in-depth, and so doing, gain an understanding of genre, style, and context.

The English Department is a team of dedicated teachers who work together to achieve the best outcomes for our students through a commitment to pedagogical excellence and reflective practice.
