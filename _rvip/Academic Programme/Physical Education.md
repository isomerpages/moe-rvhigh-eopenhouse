The Physical Education (PE) Department aims to provide a 6-year integrated PE Programme through a PE syllabus that exposes students to a variety of games such as badminton, basketball, floorball, football, frisbee, gymnastics, softball, table tennis, tchoukball, tennis and wushu. Students also learn about strategies to lead a healthy lifestyle through the Food and Consumer Education module.  

Students are also given opportunities to enrich their sporting experiences with key events such as the Healthy Lifestyle Month, Sports Carnival, Cohesion Hike, MOE-OBS Sec 3 Programme and Year 5 Growth and Empowerment Programme to complement the PE and Outdoor Education Programme in promoting a healthy and active lifestyle while building resilience and ruggedness in our students.
