## Internationalisation Programme

In our increasingly globalised world, being able to interact and work well with people from different cultures and nationalities is a crucial quality.

RVHS’ Internationalisation Programme develops students’ cultural intelligence through customised overseas immersion programmes that are designed to let students gain a deep understanding of the local culture and history, as well as interact with and befriend their overseas counterparts. Every year, students can choose from trips to many destinations, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia.

RVHS also regularly hosts visitors from overseas institutions. Thus, students have the opportunity to interact with international visitors even if they do not travel overseas.

Through the immersion programmes and interactions, students also develop a global perspective.
