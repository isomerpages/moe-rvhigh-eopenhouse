River Valley High School’s Co-curricular Activities Curriculum is designed to develop RVians’ myriad talents and passion. Our consistently high-performing co-curricular activities groups allow RVians’ talent and potential to be developed to their fullest. This will encourage RVians to develop a lifelong interest and passion that will aid them in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

Apart from building up RVians’ physical fitness and agility through the training and practice sessions, co-curricular activities are also a good platform for students to become effective team players, express their creativity and hone their leadership skills. These qualities and skills will position them well to excel in life and at work in the future.
