Composed in 2013, **立化情** is a song written by Neo Ling Wei Nicholine (Class of 2013) to welcome the new batch of Year 1 freshmen into the RV family. The 35th Student Council decided to leverage on this heartfelt song and came up with the music video production with the intention of bonding the RV family, for the alumni to reminisce the memories we had in RV, and for RVians, past and present, to be proud to be an RVian. 

立化情 tells the RV story, an experience unique to RVians. From the perspective of one who was about to complete her journey in RV, reminiscence flows; the friendships forged, memories written and the times spent with fellow peers, things close to our hearts, are common for all yet unique to each individual.

Through this, we hope to build a stronger sense of pride for the school, for all generations of RVians to treasure the friendships forged, our memories and the times that we have spent in RV, 似水流年用难忘，地久天长立化情.

#### 青春彼岸

As River Valley High School prepared to celebrate her 60th birthday, a group of young men and women decided to celebrate their fond memories of the school with a song. Titled '青春彼岸' (Qing Chun Bi An), the song was an expression of gratitude to the school as well as a wistful glance at the carefree days of being an RVian in years gone by.

It all started with a string of Alumni events, from an anniversary  dinner in November 2014 to a mass sing-a-long session in April  2015, which allowed us to gather a group of local musical talents  who were RV Alumni. The teacher representative (Mr Yeo Chengrong) then  suggested that the group could produce an original song together.  The song could build on RV’s foundation as a pioneer of the xinyao  movement in Singapore, and it would be an appropriate present to  the school during its 60th anniversary. That idea quickly took hold  and before long, the prototype was produced in December 2015  with the combined song-writing talent of Regine Han and Bevlyn  Khoo. A choir of singers was assembled – Regine Han, Bevlyn Khoo,  Jiu Jian, Edric Hsu, Tay Sia Yeun and Yeo Chengrong.

During the RV60  celebration dinner, young alumnus Nicholine Neo served as guitarist  and current student, Cai Yu Han was the keyboardist. It was indeed an  apt reflection of the RV spirit of '携手共进' , and a salutation to strong  bonds forged across batches of RVians, drawing much applause  and cheers from the guests that included past principals, teachers  and students along with the guest-of-honour, Acting Minister for  Education (Schools) Mr Ng Chee Meng. 

'青春彼岸' indeed captures the essence of the RV spirit, an  enduring quality that has distinguished the school for the last 60 years!
