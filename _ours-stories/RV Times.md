The&nbsp;**RV Times**&nbsp;is a publication showcasing the&nbsp;[RV spirit](/about-rv/svs/)&nbsp;through stories of our students, past and present. In the second issue, we highlight&nbsp;one of the five tenets of the RV spirit, which is to be&nbsp;innovative and distinctive (创新求异). We set out, in three sections, to illustrate how our school develops our current students to be future leaders, thinkers and achievers; how graduates of our Integrated Programme have pursued distinctive and possibly unconventional interests; and how our alumni have persevered to carve a niche in their careers. We hope the success stories of our alumni will inspire the young to work towards innovation and&nbsp;distinctiveness.
